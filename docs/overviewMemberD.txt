Homework 2

For this homework, I am member D (cipher)


My job is to create a function that replaces ciphered text as input and returns deciphered text using a map. It should be able to use any key.

Week 3:

    Design cipher logic
        CipherService - String decipher(String cipherText, Path keyPath)
            Loads + validates key + returns deciphered text

        CipherKey - Map<Character, Character> decodeMap
            Represents the key in memory

        CipherKeyLoader - CipherKey load(Path keyPath) - throws IOException, InvalidCipherKeyException if incorrect
            Reads the key file and constructs a CipherKey

        CipherKeyValidator - void validate(String plain, String cipher) - throws InvalidCipherKeyException if incorrect
            Checks that the plain string and the cipher string match

        InvalidCipherKeyException - custom exception
            Clean error signaling

    Decide validation rules
        - File exists and can be read
        - Outputs exactly 2 non-empty lines
        - Both lines are the same length
        - No duplicate characters in either line

    Write test cases
        CipherServiceTest
            End-to-end deciphering
            Default vs alternate key
            Punctuation and spacing behavior

        CipherKeyLoaderTest
            Loads valid key file
            Missing key file(s)
            Key file with wrong number of lines

        CipherKeyValidatorTest
            Duplicate characters
            Mismatched line lengths
            Empty key lines

    Document everything here in cipher.txt
    Write a Week 1 (of groupwork) self-reflection

Week 4
    Implement cipher class
    Implement tests
    Run full test suite
    Fix edge cases

    Test
